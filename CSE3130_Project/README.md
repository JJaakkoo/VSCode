### Reflection
As I write this, 5am passes by slowly:

    This project was pretty enjoyable, it helped me figure out blitting and how pycharm and SVC 
work together. In the future I think I should use my time more wisely, as the project is 5 hours
overdue. I had a tough time trying to create the settings menu, (which I am fairly proud of) I
explored some new ways to approach a problem. One of the solutions to many of problems ended up
being for me to just create a while loop inside another. In conclusion, I both enjoyed and learned
many things from this project/assignment... Good Night.
