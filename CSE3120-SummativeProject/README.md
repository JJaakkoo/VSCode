Jako's pirate multi day project

Extra Features:
    Cannon   
        Have an option to shoot an opponent if you have a certain amount of coins or more
        The cannon has a cool down of 4 turns
        The cannon will get rid of the selected opponent for 1-24 coins based on the win condition
        Extra feature of this extra feature??
            I made it so that the game increases the amount of damage the cannon does based on the win condition
            This applies to the amount of gold needed to use the cannon (base of 3)
    Extra players up to 10 
        Max of 10, because anymore I believe will be too chaotic
        Code is designed to run based on a choosen max player so choosing amount of players work
    Customizable win condition 
        Allows for the player to choose their desired winning condition
        The base winning condition is 20, but you can customize it to go up to 100
    
Quality of life features:
    Anti-input bugs feature (kind of..)
        This doesn't work 100% of the time
        Removes a majority of the bugs caused by input
            (eg./ TypeErrors, ValueErrors, KeyboardErrors, EOFErrors, and KeyErrors (which only occured once when I smacked my keyboard))
